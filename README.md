<h1> Python Firewall Project </h1> 

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

A Python program meant to illustrate the mechanical function of a firewall. The program was run in Visual Studio Code (Microsoft) on an Ubuntu virtual machine running on Oracle VirtualBox. 

<h2> Project Objective </h2>

Use Python coding and logic to replicate an IP network environment where a firewall evaluates an IP address that is attempting to connect. Random IP addresses are generated by the code and then the program checks the IP addresses in a dictionary (properly called a "blacklist" in the cybersecurity world) and if the generated IP address matches a listing in the dictionary then the firewall will block the IP address. If the IP address doesn't match a listing in the dictionary, then the firewall will allow the connection. The firewall decision will print to the console. 

<h2> Code Breakdown </h2> 

We start by importing the random module which is a library that is natively part of Python. It helps generate random numbers. For the purposes of this exercise it will help the program simulate network traffic to help illustrate the conditional review that a firewall does each time an IP address tries to access the network.
