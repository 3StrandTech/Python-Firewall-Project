<h1> Python Firewall Project </h1> 

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

A Python program meant to illustrate the mechanical function of a firewall. The program was run in Visual Studio Code (Microsoft) on an Ubuntu virtual machine running on Oracle VirtualBox. 

<h2> Project Objective </h2>

Use Python coding and logic to replicate an IP network environment where a firewall evaluates an IP address that is attempting to connect. Random IP addresses are generated by the code and then the program checks the IP addresses in a dictionary (properly called a "blacklist" in the cybersecurity world) and if the generated IP address matches a listing in the dictionary then the firewall will block the IP address. If the IP address doesn't match a listing in the dictionary, then the firewall will allow the connection. The firewall decision will print to the console. 

Before fully presenting the code, here is the entire program in totality. I will break down each component of the code in small segments thereafter

<h2> Code Breakdown </h2> 

We start by importing the random module which is a library that is natively part of Python. It helps generate random numbers. For the purposes of this exercise it will help the program simulate network traffic to help illustrate the conditional review that a firewall does each time an IP address tries to access the network.

Two functions are then created. One function is the "ip_gen_random" which generates a random ip address within the 172.16.0 ip address range where the fourth octet is a random number between 1 and 15. 

The "firewall_check" function which involves a for loop that evaluates the random IP address that was generated and compares it to the dictionary which is part of our "main" function (discussed in a moment). If the random IP address matches an IP address in the dictionary then the return condition of the for loop will be whatever the value is in the dictionary. If it does not match, then the return condition of the function, which is "allow," will be the result (more on how this is used later).

The "main" function consists of two main parts:

"rule_of_firewall" which is a dictionary with key value pairs, numerical IP addresses and a text string denoting in this case that these specific IP addresses will be denied access to the network if they try to obtain access.

The second part of the main function is a for loop. It has the range set to run 23 times in an effort to "pretend" to create network traffic on a fictitious network.  There will be three different variables as part of this for loop, they are: 

address_ipv4

The address_ipv4 will be the result of whatever IP address that the ip_gen_random function generates.


decision

 The decision variable is the result of the "rule_of_firewall" and "address_ipv4" arguments. "address_ipv4" is going to be the random IP address that is generated and the "rule_of_firewall" causes the "firewall" to check our dictionary. If the randomly generated IP address matches an IP address in the dictionary,  then the result of the "firewall_check" will be to "deny" the IP Address entry to the network. If the randomly generated IP does not match a key-value pair in the dictionary, then the returned result will be "allow." 

random_number 

Lastly, the random_number variable calls on the "random" module to generate a number between 0 and 864. This serves to be a unique ID number and/or "label" for the particular attempt that an IP address is trying to access the network.

The last part of the for loop is to print the result of the check that the firewall does on the generated IP addresses, which one can see in the console output below. 

At the very bottom of the program the "main guard" is used to make sure that the program runs properly and that the result is actually printed to the console as without it, the console won't print the output as intended. I deleted the "main guard" out of the code and tried to run the code a couple times and the output didn't print to the console.
